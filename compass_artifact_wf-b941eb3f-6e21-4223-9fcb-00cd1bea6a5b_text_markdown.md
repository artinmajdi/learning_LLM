- Saves 10-17 hours of taxi time daily across their network
- Reduces gate conflicts by 50%
- Saves approximately 1.4 million gallons of jet fuel annually
- Reduces CO2 emissions by over 13,000 tons

**HEAT (Hub Efficiency Analytics Tool)**: This AI system analyzes multiple data points including weather conditions, load factors, customer connections, gate availability, and air traffic control to help adjust departure and arrival times across hundreds of flights. It has significantly reduced cancellations during severe weather events.

**Cargo Prediction**: American Airlines uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of cargo no-shows, enabling more efficient cargo hold planning. This system has saved millions in potential lost revenue while optimizing aircraft weight distribution and fuel efficiency.

**Customer Service AI**: The airline integrated ASAPP's AI platform across three main business lines (Reservations, AAdvantage Customer Service, and Customer Relations) to enhance customer communications through digital channels. This implementation resulted in an 11% increase in CSAT scores within six months, with over 50% of customer inquiries now handled by automation.

American Airlines has also established a Center for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, led by Tassio Carvalho, Senior Manager for Operations Research and Machine Learning/AI. This center drives innovation across the airline's operations, focusing on practical applications that improve efficiency and customer experience.
